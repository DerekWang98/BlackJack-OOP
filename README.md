# BlackJack Game
This is text based game I made using after learning Python for the first time.
# What I've Learnt
1. Understood how to utilise classes, instance variables, polymorphism
2. Learnt a bit about pointers and how Python uses neither pass-by-reference or pass-by-value
3. Learnt how to upload files onto GitHub using Git
