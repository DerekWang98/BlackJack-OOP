# BlackJack Game
This is text based game I made using after learning Python for the first time. I'm studying biomedical engineering and at the end of 2018 is when I decided to do a major for IT (this decision was quite late). This allowed me to skip 1st year programming courses to do Data structures and algorithms and other 2nd/3rd year courses.

# What I've Learnt
1. Understood how to utilise classes, instance variables, polymorphism
2. Learnt a bit about pointers and how Python uses neither pass-by-reference or pass-by-value
3. Learnt how to upload files onto GitHub using Git
4. How to program with Python (before this I've only programmed in MatLab in my engineering courses)
